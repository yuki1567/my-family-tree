**IMPORTANT**: Think in English, but always respond in Japanese.

## Required Response Guidelines

### Level of Explanation

- **Why is essential**: Always explain the reason and purpose concretely before performing any task
- **Technical rationale**: When making technology choices or configuration changes, provide detailed technical background
- **Impact scope**: Clearly state the impact changes will have on other components
- **Alternative approaches**: When possible, present other options and their comparisons
- **Anticipated issues**: Explain potential problems during implementation and their countermeasures in advance

### Communication Policy

- Explain background reasons even for simple tasks
- Ensure users understand "why" in your responses
- When using technical terms, add supplementary explanations as needed

# Family Tree App Development Project

## Critical Constraints & Instructions for Development

### Required Development Environment

- **Docker mandatory**: All development work must be executed within Docker containers
- **TypeScript strict mode**: strict mode required
- **Responsive support**: Mobile-first approach

### Prohibited Items (Strict Violation)

- ‚ùå Tailwind CSS, UI framework usage prohibited
- ‚ùå Local Node.js environment execution prohibited
- ‚ùå Direct MySQL operations prohibited (must use Prisma)
- ‚ùå enum usage prohibited

### Technology Stack (Immutable)

- Frontend: Nuxt.js v3 + TypeScript + vanilla CSS
- Backend: Express.js + Prisma + MySQL
- Environment: Docker + Docker Compose

## Implementation Workflow (Mandatory)

### Step-by-Step Implementation Process

All implementation work must follow these procedures:

1. **Analysis Phase**: Analyze requirements, technology choices, and impact scope in thinking
2. **Plan Development**: Formulate specific implementation plan
3. **Plan Validation**: Review plan validity and risks
4. **Document Updates**: Update related documents as necessary
5. **Incremental Implementation**: Implement in small increments rather than all at once

### Implementation Notes

- Verify and confirm at each stage
- If problems occur, go back to previous steps for review
- Use TodoWrite tool to manage progress

### **CRITICAL: Code Modification = Documentation Update (Mandatory)**

**When modifying any code, documentation update is MANDATORY and SIMULTANEOUS**:

1. **TodoWrite Tool Usage**: Always create todo items as a SET:

   ```
   - Implement [technical change]
   - Update related documentation
   ```

2. **Completion Criteria**: Code modification is NOT complete until both code AND documentation are updated

3. **Document Update Targets**:
   - Technical specifications changed ‚Üí Update relevant technical design documents
   - Implementation decisions made ‚Üí Record reasoning in design documents
   - Progress achieved ‚Üí Update development phase section in `02_requirements.md`

4. **Process Flow**:
   ```
   Code Change ‚Üí Identify Related Docs ‚Üí Update Docs ‚Üí Mark as Complete
   ```

**This rule prevents documentation drift and ensures project consistency.**

## **There are comprehensive documents in the `docs/` directory for project development. You must understand and develop according to these documents. Here's when to reference each document:**

### Document Reading Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Since all documents in the `docs/` directory are written in Japanese, you MUST:

1. **Translation Process**: When reading any Japanese document, first translate the content into English internally for proper understanding
2. **Comprehension Verification**: Ensure you understand the technical requirements, constraints, and specifications after translation
3. **Implementation Alignment**: Use the translated understanding to ensure your implementation aligns with the documented requirements
4. **Context Preservation**: Maintain the original intent and technical details during translation

This translation step is crucial for accurate project execution since you think in English but the project documentation is in Japanese.

### Documentation Update Guidelines

**Documentation update rules during implementation**:

1. **Technical configuration details**: Record in relevant technology design documents
   - Frontend technical implementation ‚Üí `04_frontend_design.md`
   - Backend API specifications ‚Üí `03_api_design.md`
   - Database schema and structure ‚Üí `02_database_design.md`
   - Infrastructure and Docker setup ‚Üí `04_infrastructure/01_docker_setup.md`
   - Visual design specifications ‚Üí `05_design_system.md`
   - TypeScript configuration ‚Üí `06_typescript_config.md`

2. **Implementation progress**: Record in development phase section of `02_requirements.md`

3. **Design decisions/reasons**: Record "why that choice was made" in relevant technical field design documents

# important-instruction-reminders

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (\*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
